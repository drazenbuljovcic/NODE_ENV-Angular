# Development

## Development server

Run `npm start:dev` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. The app will automatically inject changes from the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build:dev` to build the project for development. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Linting

Run `npm run lint` to lint all your .ts files. Upon every build or starting the development server, the code is automatically linted for you.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `npm start` or `npm start:dev`.

# Production

## Build

Run `ng build:prod` to build the project for development. The optimized build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Server

Run `ng start:prod` to start the project. The application is served on port 3000, so navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`.
